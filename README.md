# Frequency-Mixer-
Our visual system instinctively selects the appropriate scale to extract relevant details from an image. For instance, signs of aging—like fine wrinkles—are usually captured in the high spatial frequency components of an image. Thus visual system uses various spatial frequencies for different face categorizations. Image I(x, y) is a finite aperiodic 2D discrete signal with intensity variations in both x and y directions. Thus to analyze frequencies, we need to find 2D discrete variable Fourier transform of I(x, y).

Write the equations governing 2D discrete variable Fourier transform. Use the Python programming to directly calculate (using available libraryvfunctions) 2D Fourier transform of any one of theinput images given to you, plot its magnitude spectra in normal form and in dB form. Where is this spectrum centered at? Can you shift it to make lower frequencies located at center of 2D transform. Rotate the input image anti-clockwise 90-degrees and plot its 2D Fourier transform magnitude spectra. Compare this spectra with original image’s spectra, write your observations. Write a Python code to creatively fuse the given two images, One provides the fine details and the other provides the overall structure of the image. This will result in a new image where different frequencies contribute to different perceptual information. Write all the details and transfer function 2D plots of your designed system. This system is known as frequency mixer.
